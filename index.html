                        We open the festival with a meditation on aesthetics. 
                        Moving slowly between gallery, studio and Karlaplan we delve into 
                        the materiality of time. Witnessing bodies gliding, twitching, meeting 
                        and transforming into new structures of matter.

                            The festival starts with four quintessential dance films. These films explore dance in relation to its surrounding landscape and environment. Some depart from an abstract theme, others develop alternative narratives.

                            Here the films are negotiating between the periphery and the centre of dance film. The body is present either by its physical absence, or its digital and heightened reality. The environment becomes the central role of the film, giving space to the choreography of the (missing) body.

                        These four films are related through slowness and existential themes. Questions are raised from the dance and its memories. The dissolution of time reminds us of human fragility.

                        In this section dance visits the life of people, 
                        their heritage and cultures. We see knowledge of dance 
                        passed on through generations, the labor of dance in the 
                        middle of Swedish nature and dance connecting families.

                            WORKSHOP: Choreographing the eye with Simon Fildes <br>
                            The core aim of the workshop is to examine and think about 
                            what editing is, and discuss what happens through editing to 
                            create a final work that might become a crafted and engaging 
                            experience for the viewer.

                            between nature, elements and human needs create alternative universes.

                            This part of the section is dedicated to David Bloom 
                            and his film trilogy “Space and sex”. We will show his 
                            dance movie Shapeshifters. Shapeshifters follow five 
                            porn actors in a dance studio busy with movement tasks 
                            and dance improvisations while they describe their porn 
                            performances. The focus is on the body, its desires and 
                            the social stigma around it.

                            and choreographer focusing on the representation of 
                            the body and its connection to voyeurism and body desires.

                                    reflection on what it means to watch and be watched. Who 
                                    gets to watch and who decides how we should watch. These 
                                    four films deals with questions about objectification inside 
                                    of institutions and the state.

            "description": "Clusters I ( a solo for dancer Rachel Tess ) and II ( a duet for dancers Agnieszka Dlugoszewska and Anna Pehrsson ) organise bodies into movement objects-circuits of energies, vibrations and flows where the gap between the problem and its solution becomes the dance. Slowly gliding through, in-between and outside of themselves and each other, these bodies are partly in symbiosis and partly out of reach. The work meets the audience as an ongoing meditation on proximity and intimacy, an invitation to other ways of being together."

            "description": "A man and a woman together alone in a relationship that seems to drain them both. Is this the end or the beginning of the end? The film Traces takes its inspiration from Jason Mabana’s dance piece ‘Last Line’ which he created for the JMD/Urban Contemporary Department of the Amsterdam School of the Arts in 2018. Director Nicola Hepp felt a deep connection to his work and juxtaposed the movement material with ideas of representing a failing relationship. The underlying sense of time, rush and fragility informs the viewer of a sadness inherent to the duet."

            "description": "Avatar of Akihiko Taniguchi appears in the virtual space. This avatar suddenly starts dancing to the music. However, artist Akihiko himself has never danced. It dances based on data downloaded from an online motion library. The movement of someone in the past has made this avatar dance. And this avatar can be replicated and has no real body. It is therefore possible to dance in the same place, penetrating each other. This work includes new ontology and body theory in virtual space. There are various things gathered together due to their history. And it is a repetitive world that mimics our real world as an entity without physical mass or body."

            "title": "Interstice",
            "description": "Probing the illusive boundary itself, Interstice presents the veil as a self-contained magic trick: a shapeshifting second skin loaded with potential energy to manipulate identities and temporal-spatial dimensions that would otherwise be rendered immeasurable in its absence.  Interstice is an attempt to pass through the veil that obscures our collective vision to reach a space in-between.  An interstitial space."

Images of the crowd appear more and more often and symbolize the current upheavals all over the world, evoking alternately parties, migrations, manifestations, gatherings or just the daily life of big cities. We thus work on the mass, with all the drunkenness it can inspire. We confront the individual with crowd movements, in order to observe how he resists or lets immerse himself."

The Swedish state sterilized tens of thousands of people within their obsession with cleaning and hygiene. Today, the fascist obsession with cleaning lives on. There are absurd designs in Sweden that try to fool us to think that 'less is more', that there is such a thing as 'blond wood', or that design, or even a line, can be 'clean'. On Animals and Cleaning brings up Sweden's dirty secrets through the absurd performative act of cleaning. The film is based on a performance with the same name."

This film makes palpable a vulnerable experience through the sensibilities and motions seen on the skin, spine, hands, and feet. The camera creates a sense of ungrounding, situation the body in a void. Off aims to create an emotional landscape through physicalizing the cinematic experience in order to seize a deeper human connection."

'Jah Intervention' is a symbolic walk to exhaustion. The intervention proposes the preliminary warm-up that precedes a fight of titans in a boxing ring. The intervention consists of the movement of the performer sensing the sudden fall when affected by perforations by bullets of semi-automatic weapons."
